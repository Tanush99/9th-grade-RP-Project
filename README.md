# 9th-grade-RP-Project

I first created an Ionic app with the optimal deep learning algorithm with tuned hyperparameters. The ensemble model and the model trained on blurred and unblurred images was not implemented into any app. Then, I created a standard React Native App. Then I created another React Native App using a StateMachine architecture.
